### Take a Screenshot of a Selected Area

Press `Shift` + `Command` + `4` to take a screenshot of a single window. The cursor will change to a crosshair. Click and drag to select the area you want to capture. The screenshot will be saved to the desktop by default.

### Take a Screenshot of a Single Window

Press `Shift` + `Command` + `4` to take a screenshot of a single window. The cursor will change to a crosshair. Move the crosshair to the window you want to capture, and then press the space bar. The cursor will change to a camera. Click the window you want to capture. The screenshot will be saved to the desktop by default.

### Take a Screenshot of the Touch Bar

Press `Shift` + `Command` + `6` to take a screenshot of the Touch Bar. The screenshot will be saved to the desktop by default.
